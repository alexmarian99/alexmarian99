### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex, a young who's passions are programming and things that require creativity. My adventure in programming started at the age of 7, and I have decided that this will be my way in my life. At the age of 18, I have discovered that I am also attracted to creative things such as artistic dances, musical instruments, illustrations, art. Since I maintain an equal balance between programming and creative hobies I have an out of the box thinking.

I'm also a people person. That means, I'm able to inspire and get inspired.

### What apps I like to develop the most âœ¨
At this moment, I like the projects that make the job of other programmers easier, or various tools that increase the speed of development.

### How to reach me ðŸ“«
I really enjoy interacting with as many people as possible. If you want to have a coffe-talk or a discussion, here are some ways you can find me ðŸ˜‹
