### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alex, a young man passionate about programming and creative stuff. My adventure in programming started at the age of 7, and I decided that this will be my way in my life. Also, at the age of 18, I discovered that I also like creative things like artistic dances, guitar. From that moment on, I maintain an equal balance between programming and creative stuff, because it helps me to have an out of the box thinking.

### What I like to develop in programming the most âœ¨
At this moment, I like the projects that makee the lives of other programmers easier, or various tools that increase the speed of development.
